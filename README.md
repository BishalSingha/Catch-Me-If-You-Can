# Catch-Me-If-You-Can
Kaggle Description: 
Web user identification is a hot research topic on the brink of sequential pattern mining and behavioural psychology.

Here we try to identify a user on the Internetby  tracking his/her sequence of attended Web pages. The algorithm to be built will take a webpage session (a sequence of webpages attended consequently by the same person) and predict whether it belongs to Alice or somebody else.

The data comes from Blaise Pascal University proxy servers. The paper "A Tool for Classification of Sequential Data" by Giacomo Kahn, Yannick Loiseau and Olivier Raynaud.

In this project, I worked towards improving an existing work and boosted the F1 score from 0.66 to 0.91
